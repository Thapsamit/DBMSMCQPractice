- Select operator in sql is equivalent to projection operator in relational algebra except that it contains duplicates.
- Query will give the 3rd highest salary. N-1 = 3-1 = 2 Can be used to find for any value of n.
-  About Weak Entity set:-
   - Weak entities can be deleted automatically when their strong entity is deleted. Correct
   - Weak entity set avoids the data duplication and consequent possible inconsistencies caused by duplicating the key of the strong entity. Correct
   - A weak entity set has no primary keys unless attributes of the strong entity set on which it depends are included Correct
   - Tuples in a weak entity set are not partitioned according to their relationship with tuples in a strong entity set.This is Incorrect, because tuples in a weak entity set are partitioned according to their relationship with tuples in a strong entity set.
- Armstrong rules = Transitivity, Augmentation and Reflexivity
- A view of database that appears to an application program is known as subschema.
- In a Hierachical database, a hashing function is used to locate the root.
